 Based on the given data and previous iteration history, here are my suggested 10 column-tool combinations for this iteration:

1. `min_max_scaler(school)` - Scale 'school' binary columns to have a common range for easier comparisons by ML model.
2. `polynomial_features(age, degree=2)` - Add polynomial features up to degree 2 to 'age' column for capturing non-linear relationships with the target variable.
3. `k_bins_discretizer(studytime, n_bins=4, encode='ordinal', strategy='quantile')` - Discretize and encode 'studytime' into 4 bins using quantiles to improve model performance.
4. `create_interaction(age, studytime)` - Create interaction terms between 'age' and 'studytime' for capturing any potential interaction effects.
5. `normalizer(failures, norm='l2')` - Normalize 'failures' column using L2-norm to make its values more interpretable and to improve model performance.
6. `apply_math_function(health, function='log')` - Apply log transformation to 'health' column for improving the normal distribution of data and making it easier for the model to learn relationships.
7. `binarizer(romantic, threshold=2)` - Binarize 'romantic' column by setting values > 2 as 1 and others as 0 for easier handling in the ML model.
8. `ordinal_encoder(reason)` - Encode categorical 'reason' column into ordinal numbers for simpler processing by the ML model.
9. `subtract_columns(traveltime, studytime)` - Subtract 'studytime' from 'traveltime' to create a new column representing travel time difference that might be useful in predicting target variable.
10. `reduce_dimentionality(columns=['failures_poly_2', 'studytime_failures_absences_PCA', 'traveltime_studytime_sub', 'studytime_poly_3'], method='PCA')` - Reduce the dimensionality of selected columns using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to create new features with optimal information retention.

These 10 column-tool combinations should help in improving the performance of the K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor model by creating new features that are highly correlated with the target variable or provide additional useful information for prediction.

 Based on the current dataset and considering the given rules, here are my suggested column-tool combinations for creating new features in this iteration:

1. `polynomial_features(failures:, degree: 2)` - Create quadratic terms of 'failures' to capture potential non-linear relationships with the target variable.
2. `k_bins_discretizer(absences:, n_bins: 5, encode: 'ordinal')` - Discretize 'absences' into bins and create ordinal encoded binary columns for each bin to better capture non-linear relationships with the target variable.
3. `subtract_columns(studytime:, failures:)` - Subtract 'failures' from 'studytime' to see if there is any correlation between the difference and the target variable.
4. `create_interaction(sex_m:, walc:)` - Create an interaction term between 'sex_m' and 'walc' as they could have different effects on the target variable.
5. `normalizer(famrel:, norm: 'l2')` - Normalize 'famrel' using L2 norm to ensure all features have similar scales.
6. `min_max_scaler(health:)` - Apply Min-Max Scaler to 'health' as it has a skewed distribution and might affect the model's performance due to its large range.
7. `apply_math_function(health:, function: 'log')` - Transform 'health' using logarithmic function to normalize extreme values.
8. `quantile_transformer(health:, n_quantiles: 5, output_distribution: 'normal')` - Quantile normalize 'health' and transform it to a normal distribution as the model might perform better with standardized features.
9. `one_hot_encoder(reason:)` - Encode categorical 'reason' column using One Hot Encoding to convert it into binary columns for the KNNR model.
10. `reduce_dimentionality(columns: ['failures', 'studytime', 'absences'], method: 'PCA')` - Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensions while retaining maximum variance, which might help in improving computational performance and reducing the impact of irrelevant or redundant features on the model.

 Based on the current dataset and previous iterations, here are my suggested 10 column-tool combinations for this iteration:

1. `poly_features(failures, degree=2)`: Create polynomial features with degree 2 to capture more complex relationships with the 'target' variable.
2. `quantile_transformer(absences, n_quantiles=100, output_distribution='normal')`: Normalize the 'absences' column using quantile normalization and make it compatible with regression models.
3. `reduce_dimentionality(columns=['studytime', 'traveltime'], method='PCA')`: Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality of studytime and traveltime columns while retaining most information.
4. `linear_combination(studytime, traveltime, weight_1=0.6, weight_2=0.4)`: Create a new feature as a linear combination of 'studytime' and 'traveltime'.
5. `binarizer(famsup, threshold=0.5)`: Binarize the 'famsup' column based on the threshold value to convert it into binary form.
6. `k_bins_discretizer(health, n_bins=5, encode='ordinal', strategy='quantile')`: Discretize the 'health' column using quantile binning to create ordinal features.
7. `min_max_scaler(ages)`: Normalize 'age' column using Min-Max Scaler for better model performance.
8. `one_hot_encoder(reason)`: One-hot encode the 'reason' column to convert categorical variables into dummy binary features.
9. `ordinal_encoder(schoolsup)`: Ordinal encode the 'schoolsup' column as it is a categorical variable with ordered labels.
10. `power_transformer(health, method='box-cox')`: Apply Box-Cox power transformation to the 'health' column to normalize its distribution and make it suitable for regression models.

These suggested column-tool combinations should help improve the ML Ridge Regression model's performance in predicting the 'target' variable based on the available features in this dataset.

 Based on the current dataset and previous iteration history, here are my suggested feature engineering and selection steps for the next iteration:

1. Polynomial Features (degree=2) on 'age': Create a new set of columns based on squared and interaction terms between existing 'age' column to capture non-linear relationships with the target variable.
   - polynomial\_features('age', degree=2)

2. One Hot Encoder for 'reason': Convert categorical 'reason' column into binary indicator columns (one for each category).
   - one_hot_encoder('reason')

3. Interaction between 'studytime' and 'famsup': Create a new feature by multiplying the existing 'studytime' and 'famsup' columns to capture their interaction effect on the target variable.
   - create_interaction('studytime', 'famsup')

4. Subtracting 'traveltime' from 'studytime': Create a new feature by subtracting 'traveltime' from 'studytime'. This could help capture the net study time available for students after adjusting for travel time.
   - subtract_columns('studytime', 'traveltime')

5. Bin Discretizer on 'health': Divide the continuous 'health' column into 5 equal bins and create new indicator columns for each bin to capture health status distribution.
   - k_bins_discretizer('health', n_bins=5, encode='ordinal')

6. Interaction between 'sex' and 'school': Create a new feature by multiplying the existing 'sex' and 'school' columns to capture any potential interaction effect on the target variable.
   - create_interaction('sex', 'school')

7. Min-Max Scaler on 'studytime_traveltime_sub': Scale 'studytime_traveltime_sub' feature using a Min-Max scaler to ensure all features have a similar range for the Ridge Regression model.
   - min_max_scaler('studytime_traveltime_sub')

8. Log Transform on 'health_log': Apply log transformation on 'health_log' feature to normalize its distribution and improve model performance.
   - apply_math_function('health_log', function='log')

9. Linear Combination between 'famsize_gt3' and 'schoolsup_yes': Create a new feature by multiplying the existing 'famsize_gt3' and 'schoolsup_yes' columns to capture their interaction effect on the target variable, then apply a normalizer to ensure it has similar scale as other features.
   - linear_combination('famsize_gt3', 'schoolsup_yes')
   - normalizer(column='linear_combination_famsize_gt3_schoolsup_yes', norm='l2')

10. Interaction between 'reason_course' and 'address_u': Create a new feature by multiplying the existing 'reason_course' and 'address_u' columns to capture any potential interaction effect on the target variable.
    - create_interaction('reason_course', 'address_u')

 Based on the current dataset and considering the given rules, here are my suggested column-tool combinations for creating new features in this iteration:

1. `polyynomial_features(failures:, degree: 2)` - Create a polynomial feature set of order 2 for the 'failures' column to capture any potential non-linear relationships with the target variable.
2. `k_bins_discretizer(traveltime:, n_bins: 5, encode: 'ordinal', strategy: 'quantile')` - Discretize 'traveltime' using 5 bins based on its quantiles to make the data more interpretable for the model.
3. `create_interaction(schoolsup:, studytime:)` - Create an interaction term between 'schoolsup' and 'studytime' columns to investigate their combined effect on the target variable.
4. `reduce_dimentionality(columns: ['famsize', 'famsup'], method: 'PCA')` - Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality of both 'famsize' and 'famsup' columns, as they might be correlated and having redundant information.
5. `apply_math_function(health:, function: 'square')` - Square the 'health' column values since squaring can sometimes bring out hidden patterns in data and improve model performance.
6. `subtract_columns(studytime:, traveltime:)` - Subtract 'traveltime' from 'studytime' to create a new feature that represents the remaining study time after accounting for travel time.
7. `one_hot_encoder(reason:)` - One-hot encode the 'reason' column to transform categorical values into binary features for easy model understanding and computation.
8. `linear_combination(studytime:, goout:, weight_1: 0.5, weight_2: 0.5)` - Create a new feature by linearly combining 'studytime' and 'goout' with equal weights of 0.5 to explore the impact of both on target variable.
9. `binarizer(guardian:, threshold: 0.5)` - Binarize the 'guardian' column if the proportion of observations with guardian being "mother" is less than 0.5, otherwise binarize it to 1 (mother) and 0 (other).
10. `quantile_transformer(absences:, n_quantiles: 3, output_distribution: 'normal')` - Apply quantile normalization on 'absences' column using a normalized distribution to make the data more symmetrical and suitable for Ridge Regression model.

 Based on the current dataset and previous iteration history, here are my suggested 10 column-tool combinations for this iteration:

1. `apply_math_function(column_name='feel_temp', function='sqrt')`
Create a new feature that applies the square root to the 'feel_temp' column values. This transformation might help as feel_temp is highly correlated with temperature and its square can have a stronger relationship with the target variable.

2. `create_interaction(column_name='humidity', column_name='windspeed')`
Create an interaction feature between 'humidity' and 'windspeed'. These two columns may have a non-linear relationship with the target, so creating their interaction could help capture such complexities.

3. `reduce_dimentionality(columns=['temp_humidity_PCA'], method='TruncatedSVD')`
Reduce the dimensionality of the 'temp_humidity_PCA' feature using TruncatedSVD. This can help in retaining significant information while reducing the computational complexity, which might be beneficial for the model.

4. `k_bins_discretizer(column_name='month', n_bins=5)`
Discretize the 'month' column into 5 bins using equal width binning. This can help in capturing any non-linear relationship that might exist between the discretized month and the target variable, which might not be captured by continuous values.

5. `one_hot_encoder(column_name='season')`
One-hot encode the 'season' column to create binary columns for each unique value (spring, summer, fall, winter). This encoding can help in making the model learn the distinct features associated with each season rather than treating them as continuous values.

6. `subtract_columns(column_name1='feel_temp', column_name2='humidity')`
Subtract the 'humidity' column from the 'feel_temp' column to create a new feature. This difference might have some relationship with the target and can help in improving the model performance.

7. `normalizer(column_name='casual', norm='l2')`
Normalize the 'casual' column using L2 normalization. Normalizing features is beneficial as it helps in putting all features on the same scale, which is important for some machine learning models like Ridge Regression.

8. `polynomial_features(column_name='humidity', degree=2)`
Create polynomial features of degree 2 (quadratic terms) for 'humidity'. This can help in capturing non-linear relationships between humidity and the target variable.

9. `quantile_transformer(column_name='temp', n_quantiles=4, output_distribution='uniform')`
Transform 'temp' data using quantile normalization with 4 equal quantiles and output uniform distribution. This transformation can help in bringing data to a similar scale, which might improve the model's performance.

10. `ordinal_encoder(column_name='weather_clear')`
One-hot encode the 'weather_clear' column since it has ordinal values (clear, partly cloudy, etc.). This encoding can help in preserving the ordering information and making the model learn distinct features for each category.

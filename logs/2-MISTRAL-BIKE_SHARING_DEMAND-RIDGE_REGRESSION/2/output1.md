 Based on the given dataset and correlation matrix, here are my suggestions for the current iteration:

1. `create_interaction(temp, humidity)`: As per the correlation matrix, there is a strong negative linear relationship between 'temp' and 'humidity'. By creating an interaction feature, we can capture the non-linear relationship (if any) between these two features and their impact on the target variable.

2. `polynomial_features(feel_temp, degree=3)`: The correlation of 'feel_temp' with 'target' is relatively high. Let's add polynomial features up to degree 3 to capture any possible non-linear relationship between them.

3. `reduce_dimentionality(columns=['temp', 'humidity'], method='PCA')`: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, preserving most of the information while reducing computational complexity and memory usage.

4. `k_bins_discretizer(windspeed, n_bins=5, encode='quantile', strategy='quantile')`: Discretizing 'windspeed' using quantiles may help in improving the model's performance since it can capture the inherent patterns or trends that might not be easily visible in continuous form.

5. `normalizer(feel_temp_humidity_combination, norm='l1')`: Normalizing a combination of 'feel_temp' and 'humidity' using L1 normalization will help each feature to have equal importance while keeping the sparsity in the data.

6. `ordinal_encoder(season)`: Encode categorical features like 'season' into numerical values as they are easier for the model to learn from.

7. `subtract_columns(temp, atemp)`: Subtracting 'atemp' from 'temp' might help to identify how much temperature deviates from the normalized feeling temperature and its impact on the target variable.

8. `min_max_scaler(windspeed)`: Scaling 'windspeed' using min-max normalization will ensure that each feature lies within a specific range (0-1), making it easier for the model to learn and understand.

9. `power_transformer(workingday_true, method='box-cox')`: Power transformation can help in reducing the skewness of the 'workingday_true' distribution and improve the model's performance.

10. `apply_math_function(temp, function='abs')`: Taking the absolute value of 'temp' may help to identify the effects of both positive and negative temperatures on the target variable since Ridge Regression is sensitive to outliers.

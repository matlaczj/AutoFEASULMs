 Based on the given information, I suggest the following 10 column-tool combinations for this iteration:

1. `min_max_scaler('length')` and `min_max_scaler('diameter')`
Create new columns 'length_scaled' and 'diameter_scaled' by applying Min-Max Scaler to the length and diameter columns, respectively. This scaling will bring both features into a similar range, potentially improving their correlation with the target feature.

2. `power_transformer('viscera_weight', method='box-cox')`
Apply Box-Cox power transformation on the 'viscera_weight' column to make its distribution more normal and increase its correlation with the target feature.

3. `k_bins_discretizer('shell_weight', n_bins=5)`
Discretize the 'shell_weight' column into 5 equal bins using KBinsDiscretizer to capture any non-linear patterns or trends in the data that might exist between shell weight and target feature.

4. `linear_combination('length', 'diameter', 0.6, 0.4)`
Create a new column 'new_feature' by linearly combining length and diameter using the weights of 0.6 for length and 0.4 for diameter. This combination might result in better correlation with the target feature if the relationship between the two input features and the target is linear.

5. `create_interaction('length', 'sex')`
Create a new binary interaction column 'length_x_sex' to capture any potential interactions between length and sex on the target variable. This could be important since there might be different growth patterns or aging rates based on abalone sex.

6. `subtract_columns('height', 'diameter')`
Create a new column 'height_minus_diameter' by subtracting diameter from height to capture the difference between the two measurements, which could potentially have a stronger correlation with the target feature.

7. `polynomial_features('viscera_weight', degree=2)`
Add polynomial features of degree 2 for 'viscera_weight' column to capture any non-linear patterns that might exist in the relationship between viscera weight and target variable.

8. `ordinal_encoder('sex')`
Encode the sex categorical feature into a new binary (0,1) or dummy encoded format using OrdinalEncoder. This will help the Ridge Regression model to better understand the sex feature as numerical input.

9. `max_abs_scaler('whole_weight')`
Apply Max Abs Scaler on 'whole_weight' column to bring all values to a similar range and prevent any single heavy weighted data point dominating the model.

10. `reduce_dimentionality(columns=['length_diameter_inter_min_max_scaled', 'viscera_weight_log'], method='PCA')`
Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the selected columns 'length_diameter_inter_min_max_scaled' and 'viscera_weight_log' to reduce their dimensionality and capture most of their variance while keeping the number of features as minimal as possible. This will help in improving the model's performance by reducing overfitting and increasing interpretability.

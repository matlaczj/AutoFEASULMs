 Based on the given information, I suggest the following 10 column-tool combinations for this iteration:

1. `min_max_scaler('diameter')`: This scaling will make the distribution of diameter values more uniform, which can help improve the model's performance since Ridge Regression works better with standardized data.
2. `quantile_transformer('viscera_weight', n_quantiles=100, output_distribution='normal')`: Transforming viscera_weight to a normal distribution may be beneficial as Ridge Regression assumes homoscedasticity (constant variance) in the data and having symmetrically distributed features can aid in achieving that assumption.
3. `polynomial_features('height', degree=2)`: Adding polynomial features can help capture non-linear relationships between the height column and other columns, potentially improving model performance.
4. `reduce_dimentionality(columns=['length_min_max_scaled', 'diameter_min_max_scaled'], method='PCA')`: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be applied to reduce dimensionality while retaining maximum variance, potentially leading to a simpler model and improved performance.
5. `linear_combination('length_min_max_scaled', 'diameter_min_max_scaled', weight_1=0.8, weight_2=0.2)`: Combining linearly transformed columns can create new features that are important for the model, based on the given high correlation between length and diameter.
6. `k_bins_discretizer('whole_weight', n_bins=5, encode='ordinal')`: Discretizing whole_weight into 5 equal bins can be helpful as Ridge Regression may perform better when working with categorical or ordinal features.
7. `create_interaction(column_name_1='height', column_name_2='sex_m')`: Creating an interaction feature between height and sex_m can help capture any potential non-linear relationship between these columns and the target variable 'target'.
8. `ordinal_encoder(column_name='sex')`: Encode categorical variables using ordinal encoding can be useful when working with Ridge Regression, as it provides an ordered representation of categorical data and might help improve model performance.
9. `subtract_columns('height', 'shell_weight')`: Subtracting the shell weight from height may provide valuable insights into the relationship between meat thickness and other factors and could be beneficial for the model.
10. `max_abs_scaler('viscera_weight')`: This scaling will help ensure that large negative values in viscera_weight do not dominate the feature space, potentially improving model performance.

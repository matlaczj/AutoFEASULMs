 Based on the given information, I suggest the following 10 column-tool combinations for this iteration:

1. `min_max_scaler('diameter')`: Scaling diameter data to bring all measurements within a similar range.
2. `polynomial_features('length', degree=3)`: Adding polynomial features of third degree to the length column.
3. `linear_combination('shucked_weight', 'viscera_weight', 0.5, 0.5)`: Creating a new feature by taking an equal linear combination of shucked_weight and viscera_weight.
4. `create_interaction('length', 'diameter')`: Creating interaction terms between length and diameter columns to capture the non-linear relationship between them.
5. `log_transformer('viscera_weight')`: Transforming viscera_weight column using logarithmic transformation to normalize extreme values.
6. `k_bins_discretizer('length', n_bins=10, encode='quantile')`: Discretizing length data into 10 equal quantiles for easier modeling.
7. `reduce_dimentionality(columns=['height', 'diameter'], method='PCA')`: Reducing dimensionality of the height and diameter columns using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
8. `ordinal_encoder('sex')`: Encoding sex as ordinal variables for easier modeling in Ridge Regression.
9. `apply_math_function('whole_weight', function='square')`: Squaring the whole_weight column to explore its relationship with target variable 'rings'.
10. `subtract_columns('height', 'diameter')`: Subtracting height from diameter to create a new feature that could potentially be more correlated with target 'rings'.

These combinations were selected considering the following factors:
- The correlation between some columns and the target variable 'rings' (length, diameter, whole_weight, shucked_weight, viscera_weight, shell_weight) were high.
- Some columns had large ranges that could benefit from scaling to reduce the impact of outliers.
- Creating interaction terms between length and diameter could capture non-linear relationships between them.
- Transforming some columns using power transformations or logarithmic transformation could help improve their relationship with the target variable.
- Reducing dimensionality using PCA could potentially result in features that are more representative of the data while reducing the complexity of the model.
- Encoding categorical variables could make it easier for the Ridge Regression model to understand and process them as numerical values.

 Based on the given information, here are ten potential column-tool combinations that could be explored in this iteration for feature engineering:

1. `create_interaction(length, diameter)`: Creating an interaction term between 'length' and 'diameter', as their correlation is relatively high (0.92). This interaction might capture more complex relationships that the Ridge Regression model can utilize.

2. `polynomial_features(whole_weight, degree=3)`: Transforming 'whole_weight' using polynomial features of degree 3 to capture non-linear trends and potential higher order interactions with other features.

3. `k_bins_discretizer(length, n_bins=5, strategy='quantile')`: Discretizing 'length' into five equal-sized bins using the quantile discretization method to create categorical features that could capture different groups within the length range.

4. `subtract_columns(height, diameter)`: Subtracting 'diameter' from 'height' to create a new feature that might be useful in predicting the target 'rings'. This difference could represent an aspect of the abalone's shape that is related to its age.

5. `power_transformer(viscera_weight, method='yeo-johnson')`: Applying Yeo-Johnson power transformation to 'viscera_weight' to normalize its distribution and potentially improve the model's ability to learn from this feature.

6. `normalizer(whole_weight, norm='l2')`: Normalizing 'whole_weight' using L2 normalization to bring all features to a similar scale and help the Ridge Regression model compare them more effectively.

7. `quantile_transformer(shucked_weight, n_quantiles=3, output_distribution='normal')`: Transforming 'shucked_weight' into its corresponding quantiles (quartiles) using normal distribution to create new features that might be helpful in predicting the target 'rings'.

8. `min_max_scaler(viscera_weight)`: Min-Max scaling 'viscera_weight' to bring all feature values within a common range (between 0 and 1). This transformation can make it easier for Ridge Regression to understand the relationship between this feature and the target.

9. `ordinal_encoder(sex)`: Encoding the categorical 'sex' feature into ordinal numbers (M = 1, F = 2, I = 3) to create a new feature that can be used directly by Ridge Regression for predicting the target 'rings'.

10. `reduce_dimentionality(columns=['length', 'diameter', 'height'], method='PCA')`: Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the selected columns ('length', 'diameter', and 'height') to reduce their dimensionality while retaining most of the important information. This new feature could improve model performance by simplifying the input space without losing much information.

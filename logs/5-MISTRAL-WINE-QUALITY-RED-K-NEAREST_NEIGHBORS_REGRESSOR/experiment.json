It likely represents different classes or categories.\nfixed_acidity: This column represents the amount of non-volatile acids in the wine. It's usually measured in grams per liter.\nvolatile_acidity: This column represents the amount of volatile acids in the wine, which can contribute to the vinegar-like taste. It's also measured in grams per liter.\ncitric_acid: This column represents the amount of citric acid in the wine. Citric acid can impart freshness and flavor to the wine. It's measured in grams per liter.\nresidual_sugar: This column represents the amount of sugar that remains in the wine after fermentation is complete. It's measured in grams per liter.\nchlorides: This column represents the amount of salt in the wine. It's measured in grams per liter.\nfree_sulfur_dioxide: This column represents the amount of free sulfur dioxide in the wine, which acts as a preservative and antimicrobial agent. It's measured in parts per million (ppm).\ntotal_sulfur_dioxide: This column represents the total amount of sulfur dioxide in the wine, including both free and bound forms. It's also measured in parts per million (ppm).\ndensity: This column represents the density of the wine, which is influenced by the concentration of alcohol and sugar. It's usually measured in grams per milliliter.\npH: This column represents the acidity or basicity of the wine on a scale from 0 to 14, with lower values indicating higher acidity.\nsulphates: This column represents the amount of sulfur dioxide added to the wine as a preservative. It's measured in grams per liter.\nalcohol: This column represents the alcohol content of the wine, usually measured as the percentage of alcohol by volume.\n\n"}, "problem": {"type": "regression", "machine_learning_model": "K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor", "model": "KNeighborsRegressor()", "param_grid": {"n_neighbors": [1, 3, 5, 9, 15], "weights": ["uniform", "distance"], "p": [1, 2]}}, "feature_engineering": {"iterations": 5, "early_stopping": 3, "percentage_change_threshold": 0, "n_new_features": 10, "n_unique_values": 10, "perc_digits_after_decimal": 10, "correlations_threshold": 0.3, "temperature": 0.8, "n_most_correlated": 50, "threshold_features": 0.95, "preserve_base_features": true, "delayed_deletion": 0, "n_sampled_corr": 50}, "validation": {"kfold": 10, "scorers": {"classification": "<function accuracy_score at 0x000001A828965750>", "regression": "<function mean_absolute_percentage_error at 0x000001A828A81EA0>"}}, "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"transformations": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"function": {"type": "string", "enum": ["standard_scaler", "min_max_scaler", "max_abs_scaler", "quantile_transformer", "power_transformer", "apply_math_function", "normalizer", "binarizer", "polynomial_features", "k_bins_discretizer", "ordinal_encoder", "one_hot_encoder", "linear_combination", "create_interaction", "subtract_columns", "reduce_dimentionality"]}, "columns": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["petal_length", "petal_width", "sepal_length", "sepal_width", "species"]}}, "numerical_arguments": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "number"}}, "categorical_arguments": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string", "enum": ["uniform", "normal", "yeo-johnson", "box-cox", "max", "ordinal", "quantile", "kmeans", "log", "sqrt", "exp", "square", "cube", "inverse", "log2", "log10", "abs", "ceil", "floor", "round", "l1", "l2", "PCA", "TruncatedSVD", "FastICA", "FactorAnalysis"]}}}, "required": ["function", "columns", "numerical_arguments", "categorical_arguments"]}}}, "required": ["transformations"]}}

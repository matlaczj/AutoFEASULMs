 Based on the given dataset and columns, here are ten potential feature engineering ideas for improving the performance of a K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor model in predicting the target variable 'class':

1. Create a new feature named `acidity_score` using a weighted sum of `fixed_acidity` and `volatile_acidity`, with weights determined by their correlation with the target. For instance: `linear_combination(fixed_acidity, volatile_acidity, 0.44, -0.35)`.
2. Apply a power transformation (Box-Cox method) to the 'density' column to make it more normally distributed and reduce skewness, which might help improve model performance: `power_transformer(density, method='box-cox')`.
3. Create interaction features between 'total_sulfur_dioxide' and 'fixed_acidity', 'volatile_acidity', and 'pH' to capture potential non-linear relationships: `create_interaction(total_sulfur_dioxide, fixed_acidity)`, `create_interaction(total_sulfur_dioxide, volatile_acidity)`, and `create_interaction(total_sulfur_dioxide, pH)`.
4. Use a polynomial degree of 2 to capture non-linear relationships between 'residual_sugar' and other features: `polynomial_features(residual_sugar, degree=2)`.
5. Create a new feature named 'acidity_ratio' by dividing `fixed_acidity` by `volatile_acidity` to better understand the relationship between these two factors.
6. Standardize 'citric_acid', 'chlorides', and 'sulphates' columns using z-score normalization: `standard_scaler(citric_acid)`, `standard_scaler(chlorides)`, and `standard_scaler(sulphates)`.
7. Use MinMaxScaler on the 'alcohol' column to make sure all values are within a specific range, which might help improve model performance: `min_max_scaler(alcohol)`.
8. Discretize 'pH' into five bins using equal width encoding strategy: `k_bins_discretizer(pH, n_bins=5, encode='ordinal', strategy='uniform')`.
9. Use OneHotEncoder on 'class' column to create binary indicator features for each unique class: `one_hot_encoder(class)`.
10. Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and improve model performance while retaining most of the important information: `reduce_dimentionality(columns=['fixed_acidity', 'volatile_acidity', 'citric_acid', 'residual_sugar', 'chlorides', 'free_sulfur_dioxide', 'total_sulfur_dioxide', 'density'], method='PCA')`.

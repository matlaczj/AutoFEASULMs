 Based on the given data and correlations, here are 10 new column-tool combinations that can be created in this iteration to improve ML Ridge Regression model for predicting 'target':

1. `polynomial_features('wheel-base', degree: 2)` and `linear_combination('length', 'wheel-base')` - Creating polynomial features up to degree 2 from wheel-base and combining it with length as they have a strong correlation of 0.83.
2. `normalizer('width', norm: 'l2')` and `k_bins_discretizer('height', n_bins: 5, encode: 'ordinal', strategy: 'quantile)' - Normalizing the width using L2 normalization and discretizing the height with 5 bins using quantile strategy to handle non-linear relationships.
3. `power_transformer('city-mpg', method: 'yeo-johnson')` and `subtract_columns('city-mpg', 'highway-mpg')` - Applying Yeo-Johnson power transformation on city-mpg and subtracting it from highway-mpg to highlight the difference between city and highway mpg.
4. `ordinal_encoder('symboling')` and `create_interaction(symboling, length)` - Encoding symboling as ordinal and creating interaction features with length for better representation of categorical variables.
5. `min_max_scaler('curb-weight')` and `binarizer('target', threshold: 10.2)` - Scaling curb-weight using Min-Max scaler and binarizing target column with a threshold of 10.2 to handle extreme values.
6. `quantile_transformer('horsepower', n_quantiles: 4, output_distribution: 'normal')` and `reduce_dimentionality(columns=['bore', 'stroke'], method: 'PCA')` - Transforming horsepower using quantile transformer with normal distribution and reducing dimensionality of bore and stroke columns using PCA.
7. `apply_math_function('target', function: 'log')` and `linear_combination('city-mpg', 'highway-mpg')` - Taking log of target column values and creating a linear combination of city-mpg and highway-mpg for better understanding of their impact on target.
8. `one_hot_encoder('target')` and `k_bins_discretizer('normalized-losses', n_bins: 10, encode: 'ordinal', strategy: 'uniform)` - One-hot encoding the target column and discretizing normalized-losses using uniform strategy with 10 bins to better represent categorical data.
9. `power_transformer('height', method: 'box-cox')` and `subtract_columns('length', 'wheel-base')` - Applying Box-Cox power transformation on height column and subtracting length and wheel-base columns for feature interaction.
10. `normalizer('city-mpg', norm: 'max')` and `create_interaction(horsepower, city-mpg)` - Normalizing city-mpg using max normalization and creating interaction features between horsepower and city-mpg to understand their relationship better.

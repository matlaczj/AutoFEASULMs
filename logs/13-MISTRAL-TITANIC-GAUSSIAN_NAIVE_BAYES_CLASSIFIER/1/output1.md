 Based on the current iteration and given information, here are ten potential feature engineering steps to improve the Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier model:

1. `one_hot_encoder(column_name:'sex')`
Apply one-hot encoding to the 'sex' column as it is a categorical variable with two distinct values. This will create new binary features for each unique value (male and female).

2. `ordinal_encoder(column_name:'class')`
Apply ordinal encoding to the 'class' column as it is an ordinal variable, meaning that there is an inherent order or ranking among the categories. This will map each unique category to a number based on its position in the order.

3. `k_bins_discretizer(column_name:'age', n_bins=5, encode='ordinal')`
Discretize the 'age' column using equal width bins and ordinal encoding with five bins to reduce the dimensionality while preserving some information from the original continuous data.

4. `create_interaction(column_name_1='sex', column_name_2='class')`
Create an interaction feature between 'sex' and 'class' by multiplying their binary encoded values, which can potentially capture any synergistic effect between the two features.

5. `subtract_columns(column_name_1='age', column_name_2='fare')`
Create a new feature by subtracting the 'age' column from the 'fare' column as there could be some relationship between age and fare, which might help improve the model's performance.

6. `quantile_transformer(column_name='fare', n_quantiles=10, output_distribution='normal')`
Apply quantile normalization to the 'fare' column using a normal distribution to transform the feature values into a more Gaussian-like shape. This could improve model performance as Naive Bayes algorithms often work better with Gaussian distributions.

7. `power_transformer(column_name='age', method='box-cox')`
Apply the Box-Cox power transformation on the 'age' column to make it more normally distributed, which could help improve model performance as Naive Bayes algorithms have assumptions about feature distribution.

8. `linear_combination(column_name_1='fare', column_name_2='age', weight_1=0.5, weight_2=-0.3)`
Create a new linear combination of 'fare' and 'age' features by multiplying their values with given weights and summing them up. This could capture some hidden relationship between the two features that might not be apparent when considering them separately.

9. `standard_scaler(column_name='fare')`
Apply standard scaling to the 'fare' column as it is a continuous variable, ensuring each feature value has zero mean and unit variance, which helps in making the Gaussian distribution more symmetric and centered around 0. This could improve model performance by making the input features more uniform.

10. `polynomial_features(column_name='age', degree=2)`
Create polynomial features up to second order for the 'age' column to capture non-linear relationships between the target variable and age, which might be missed when using only the original age feature.

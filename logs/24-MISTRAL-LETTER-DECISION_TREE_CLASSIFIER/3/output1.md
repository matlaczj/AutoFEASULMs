 Based on the given information, here are my suggestions for creating new columns in this iteration:

1. `x-ege_high_inter`: Create an interaction between 'x-ege' and 'high' to understand how these two features relate to the target class.
2. `onpix_width_scaled`: Apply min-max scaler on 'onpix' and 'width' columns to ensure both are on a similar scale before creating new features from them.
3. `x-box_high_inter`: Create an interaction between 'x-box' and 'high' to understand how these two features relate to the target class.
4. `y-ege_onpix_scaled`: Apply standard scaler on both 'y-ege' and 'onpix' columns before creating new features from them, as they have a moderate correlation.
5. `x-box_power_transformed_yegvx`: Power transform 'x-box' using Yeo-Johnson method and create an interaction with 'y-ege' and 'x'.
6. `width_onpix_product`: Multiply 'width' and 'onpix' columns to create a new feature representing the area of the bounding box.
7. `y-box_power_transformed_xy2br`: Power transform 'y-box' using Yeo-Johnson method and create an interaction with 'x-bar', 'y2bar' and 'xy2br'.
8. `high_width_sum`: Sum 'high' and 'width' columns to create a new feature representing the total height and width of the bounding box.
9. `onpix_quantiled_n=50_distr=normal`: Apply quantile transformation using normal distribution on the 'onpix' column.
10. `x-ege_abs_high`: Take absolute value of both 'x-ege' and 'high' columns to create a new feature that could be useful for identifying extreme values in the data.

 Based on the current dataset and previous iterations, here are ten new column-tool combinations that could potentially improve the performance of the Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier for predicting the target variable 'target':

1. `education_num_log = log_transformer(education-num)`: Since education-num is a numerical encoding of the highest level of education achieved, taking its logarithm could help improve model performance as it might normalize the distribution and bring out more distinct features for the classifier to learn.
2. `marital_status_married_spouse_absent_workclass_self_emp_inter = create_interaction(marital-status_married-spouse-absent, workclass_self-emp-not-inc)`: Creating an interaction feature between marital-status and workclass might help capture more complex relationships between these features and the target variable.
3. `capitalloss_2_mean = mean_transformer(capitalloss_2)`: Taking the mean of capitalloss_2 could help normalize its values and make it easier for the model to learn patterns.
4. `hoursperweek_1_maritalstatus_nevermarried_sub = subtract_columns(hoursperweek_1, marital-status_never-married)`: Subtracting marital-status_never-married from hoursperweek_1 might help create a new feature that is highly correlated with the target variable.
5. `workclass_local_gov_onehot = one_hot_encoder(workclass_local-gov)`: Encoding workclass_local-gov as one-hot might help the model learn distinct features for each unique value in this column and improve its ability to capture their relationship with the target variable.
6. `age_3_education_num_inter = create_interaction(age_3, education-num)`: Creating an interaction feature between age and education-num might help capture more complex relationships between these features and the target variable.
7. `capitalgain_3_sqrt = square_root_transformer(capitalgain_3)`: Taking the square root of capitalgain_3 could help normalize its values and make it easier for the model to learn patterns.
8. `fnlwgt_quantiled_n=50_distr=uniform = quantile_transformer(fnlwgt, 50, output_distribution='uniform')`: Quantiling fnlwgt with a uniform distribution and keeping only the 50th percentile might help create a new feature that is highly correlated with the target variable.
9. `marital_status_divorced_workclass_state_gov_inter = create_interaction(marital-status_divorced, workclass_state-gov)`: Creating an interaction feature between marital-status and workclass might help capture more complex relationships between these features and the target variable.
10. `age_2_capitalgain_4_sub = subtract_columns(age_2, capitalgain_4)`: Subtracting capitalgain_4 from age_2 might help create a new feature that is highly correlated with the target variable.

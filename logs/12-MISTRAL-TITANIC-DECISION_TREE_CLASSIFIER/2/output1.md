 Based on the current iteration and given dataset, here are ten potential feature engineering steps to improve the performance of the Decision Tree Classifier model in predicting the 'Survived' target variable:

1. **one\_hot\_encoder(column_name='Sex'):** One-hot encoding is a useful technique for categorical features like 'Sex', which will create new binary columns for each unique value ('male', 'female'). This can help the model better capture the relationship between gender and survival probability.

2. **ordinal\_encoder(column_name='Pclass'):** Ordinal encoding is another option to encode categorical features such as passenger class. Unlike one-hot encoding, this method assigns a sequential integer value to each category based on their order. This could be useful if the model can learn any inherent ordering in the data (first class > second class > third class).

3. **k_bins_discretizer(column_name='Age', n_bins=10, encode='ordinal'):** Discretizing the 'Age' column into ten equal-sized bins could be beneficial to capture age groups that have similar survival probabilities. Since this is an ordinal encoding method, each bin will receive a unique integer value from 1 to 10.

4. **create_interaction(column_name_1='Sex', column_name_2='Pclass'):** Creating interaction terms between 'Sex' and 'Pclass' can help capture any non-linear relationship that might exist between the two features and survival probability.

5. **subtract_columns(column_name_1='Age', column_name_2='Fare'):** Subtracting 'Fare' from 'Age' might reveal a new insight. This difference could be interpreted as "age-for-fare," which can be an essential feature for understanding the relationship between financial resources and survivability on the Titanic.

6. **apply_math_function(column_name='Fare', function='log'):** Taking the natural logarithm of 'Fare' might help the model better capture any underlying patterns or relationships when predicting survival probabilities based on passengers' fares.

7. **linear_combination(column_name_1='Pclass', column_name_2='Fare', weight_1=0.8, weight_2=-0.5):** Combining 'Pclass' and 'Fare' using a linear combination might be helpful in understanding the interplay between these two features in determining survival probability. In this case, we assume that a higher passenger class is 0.8 times as important as fare in predicting survival.

8. **min_max_scaler(column_name='Age'):** Scaling 'Age' using Min-Max scaling could help to normalize the feature and make it more suitable for machine learning algorithms, especially for models that are sensitive to input scales like Decision Trees.

9. **power_transformer(column_name='Fare', method='box-cox'):** Box-Cox power transformation is a powerful technique that can help normalize non-normally distributed features like 'Fare.' By applying this transformer, we'll obtain a new feature with potentially better predictive capabilities for the Decision Tree Classifier.

10. **reduce_dimentionality(columns=['Pclass', 'Sex', 'Age'], method='PCA'):** Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is an effective dimensionality reduction technique that can help us create new features by transforming the existing ones into a smaller set of orthogonal components while preserving most of their variance. This might provide a more compact representation of the data for the Decision Tree Classifier to work with.

 Based on the current iteration and given information, here are ten potential feature engineering steps to improve the ML Decision Tree Classifier model:

1. **Title encoding**: Use `one_hot_encoder()` on 'Title' column to transform categorical data into numerical values for better model performance.
2. **Age binarization**: Use `k_bins_discretizer()` with a strategy of 'quantile' and n_bins=5 to discretize the 'Age' column into bins representing age groups, which could be highly correlated with survival probability.
3. **Fare quantile normalization**: Apply `min_max_scaler()` on 'Fare' column to normalize the values between 0 and 1, as fares might have a significant correlation with survival rates.
4. **Interaction between sex and class**: Create interaction features using `create_interaction()` function by combining 'Sex' and 'Pclass' columns to explore potential interactions between these two important factors.
5. **Relative count encoding**: Use `ordinal_encoder()` on the 'relatives' column to encode ordinal data into numerical values, as this could provide insights for model prediction.
6. **Power transformation - Box-Cox**: Apply power transformation using `power_transformer()` with method='box-cox' on 'Age' and 'Fare' columns to improve the model's ability to handle nonlinearly related features.
7. **Polynomial features for class**: Create polynomial features for 'Pclass' column using `polynomial_features()` to explore potential nonlinear relationships between this feature and the target variable.
8. **Fare square**: Apply `apply_math_function()` with function='square' on the 'Fare' column to create a new square fare feature, which might have a significant correlation with passenger survival rates.
9. **Age and Fare interaction**: Create an interaction feature using `create_interaction()` between 'Age' and 'Fare' columns to explore potential correlations between these two features and the target variable.
10. **Embarked encoding**: Use `one_hot_encoder()` on 'Embarked' column to transform categorical data into numerical values, which could be beneficial for model prediction given that port of embarkation might have influenced survival rates.

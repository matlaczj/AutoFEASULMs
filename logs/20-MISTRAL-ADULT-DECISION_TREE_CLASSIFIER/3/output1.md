 Based on the current dataset and previous iteration history, here are my recommendations for creating 10 new feature columns using existing ones:

1. Capital gain and loss interaction: 'capitalgain_3_capitalloss_4_combination'
Create an interaction term between capital gain (column 'capitalgain_3') and capital loss (column 'capitalloss_4').
2. Workclass and marital status combination: 'workclass_marital-status_inter'
Create a new column by combining 'workclass' and 'marital-status' columns, which can provide more context for the model.
3. Hours per week squared: 'hoursperweek_sq'
Add the square of 'hoursperweek' to capture non-linear relationships between hours worked and income.
4. Education number and relationship status intersection: 'education-num_relationship_inter'
Create an interaction term between 'education-num' and 'relationship' columns, which might provide insight into the impact of education level on specific relationship types.
5. Log transformation of fnlwgt: 'ln_fnlwgt'
Apply a logarithmic transformation to the 'fnlwgt' column as it may help normalize extreme values and make the distribution more Gaussian, making models perform better.
6. Marital status encoding: 'marital-status_encoded'
Apply one-hot encoding on 'marital-status' to convert categorical variables into binary indicators.
7. Age and workclass combination: 'age_workclass_inter'
Create an interaction term between 'age' and 'workclass' columns as they might be related to income.
8. Capital gain and hour per week interaction: 'capitalgain_hoursperweek_inter'
Create an interaction term between 'capitalgain_3' and 'hoursperweek' columns, which could provide insight into the impact of hours worked on capital gains.
9. Race encoding: 'race_encoded'
Apply one-hot encoding on 'race' column to convert categorical variables into binary indicators.
10. Age group based on decade: 'age_decade'
Create a new column with age groups defined by decades (e.g., 0 for age under 10, 1 for age between 10-20, etc.) to help capture trends in income related to age groups.

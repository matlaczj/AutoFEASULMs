 Based on the current dataset and previous iteration history, here are ten new column-tool combinations that could potentially improve the ML Decision Tree Classifier model:

1. `polynomial_features(education-num, degree=2)`: Adding quadratic terms to the existing education-num feature might help capture more complex relationships with the target variable 'target'.

2. `k_bins_discretizer(fnlwgt, n_bins=5, encode='ordinal', strategy='quantile')`: Discretizing the fnlwgt column using equal width quantiles could help improve model performance by reducing the continuous nature of the data.

3. `apply_math_function(hoursperweek_1, function='square')`: Squaring hoursperweek_1 might reveal hidden relationships with other features that could be beneficial for the model.

4. `subtract_columns(age, education)`: Subtracting age from education might create a new feature revealing an interesting relationship between age and education levels.

5. `ordinal_encoder(marital-status)`: Encoding marital-status as ordinal features could help capture the inherent ordering in this nominal variable.

6. `linear_combination(hoursperweek_2, hoursperweek_3, weight_1=0.5, weight_2=0.5)`: Creating a new feature as a linear combination of hoursperweek_2 and hoursperweek_3 might capture a unique relationship not present in either column alone.

7. `min_max_scaler(capitalgain_1)`: Scaling the capitalgain_1 column using min-max normalization could help ensure that each feature is on a comparable scale for the ML Decision Tree Classifier model.

8. `create_interaction(workclass, marital-status)`: Creating interaction features between workclass and marital-status might uncover interesting relationships not present in either column alone.

9. `power_transformer(capitalloss_3, method='yeo-johnson')`: Applying Yeo-Johnson power transformation on capitalloss_3 could help normalize the distribution and reduce the skewness.

10. `one_hot_encoder(education)`: One-hot encoding the education column might help the ML Decision Tree Classifier model learn specific relationships between each unique education level and the target variable 'target'.

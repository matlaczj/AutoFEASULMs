 Based on the current iteration history and the available columns, here are 10 new column-tool combinations that could potentially improve the performance of the Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier model in predicting the 'target' variable:

1. **Polynomial features**: Create interaction terms between highly correlated features such as 'age_poly_2' and 'installment_commitment_duration_inter'. Degree: 2.
    `create_interaction(column_name='age_poly_2', column_name='installment_commitment_duration_inter')`

2. **One-hot encoder**: Encode categorical features with many unique values such as 'credit_history' and 'personal_status'.
    `one_hot_encoder(column_name='credit_history')`
    `one_hot_encoder(column_name='personal_status')`

3. **Binarizer**: Convert continuous features with only a few unique values into binary features, such as 'checking_status' and 'housing'.
    `binarizer(column_name='checking_status', threshold=200)`
    `binarizer(column_name='housing', threshold=1)`

4. **Power transformer**: Apply Yeo-Johnson power transformation to features that have non-normal distribution, such as 'age_residence_since_sub' and 'existing_credits'.
    `power_transformer(column_name='age_residence_since_sub', method='yeo-johnson')`
    `power_transformer(column_name='existing_credits', method='yeo-johnson')`

5. **Linear combination**: Create a new feature by combining two features that have a high positive correlation, such as 'savings_status' and 'duration'.
    `linear_combination(column_name_1='savings_status', column_name_2='duration', weight_1=0.5, weight_2=0.5)`

6. **Subtract columns**: Create a new feature by subtracting one column from another, such as 'checking_status_<0' and 'existing_credits'.
    `subtract_columns(column_name_1='checking_status_<0>', column_name_2='existing_credits')`

7. **Ordinal encoder**: Encode ordinal features like 'employment' to create dummy variables for each category.
    `ordinal_encoder(column_name='employment')`

8. **Min-max scaler**: Scale numerical columns to a specific range, such as 'age' and 'credit_amount'.
    `min_max_scaler(column_name='age')`
    `min_max_scaler(column_name='credit_amount')`

9. **K-bins discretizer**: Discretize continuous features into bins, such as 'installment_commitment' and 'duration'.
    `k_bins_discretizer(column_name='installment_commitment', n_bins=5)`
    `k_bins_discretizer(column_name='duration', n_bins=10, strategy='quantile')`

10. **Reduce dimensionality**: Use PCA to reduce the number of features while preserving most of the variance in the data, such as 'checking_status_0<=x<200' and 'credit_history_no_credits/all_paid'.
    `reduce_dimentionality(columns=['checking_status_0<=x<200', 'credit_history_no_credits/all_paid'], method='PCA')`

 Based on the current dataset and the history of iterations, here are 10 new column-tool combinations that could potentially improve the performance of the Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier model:

1. `polynomial_features(credit_history, degree=3)` - Adding polynomial features up to degree 3 for the 'credit\_history' column might help capture non-linear relationships and interactions with other features.
2. `k_bins_discretizer(age, n_bins=5, strategy='quantile')` - Discretizing the 'age' column using quantiles into 5 bins could improve model performance by reducing noise and making the data more manageable for the classifier.
3. `apply_math_function(installment_commitment, function='log')` - Taking the log of the 'installment\_commitment' feature might help normalize large values and make the distribution more Gaussian-like.
4. `subtract_columns(existing_credits, checking_status)` - Subtracting the 'existing\_credits' column from the 'checking\_status' column could create a new feature that represents the change in credit status, which might be informative for predicting credit risk.
5. `create_interaction(installment_rate, duration)` - Creating an interaction term between 'installment\_rate' and 'duration' might help capture their interdependence and improve model accuracy.
6. `reduce_dimentionality(columns=['credit_amount', 'savings_status'], method='PCA')` - Reducing the dimensionality of 'credit\_amount' and 'savings\_status' using PCA might help remove noise and improve model interpretability without losing much important information.
7. `ordinal_encoder(personal_status)` - Encoding the 'personal\_status' column as ordinal values could help make the feature more amenable to Naive Bayes classification by preserving the ordering of categories.
8. `quantile_transformer(age, n_quantiles=5, output_distribution='uniform')` - Transforming the 'age' column using quantiles into 5 bins and outputting a uniform distribution might help normalize age data and make it more suitable for Gaussian models.
9. `max_abs_scaler(existing_credits)` - Scaling the 'existing\_credits' column using max\_abs\_scaler could help normalize large values and ensure equal importance of all credit values.
10. `binarizer(checking_status, threshold=300)` - Binarizing the 'checking\_status' column at a threshold of 300 might help simplify the data for the classifier by reducing continuous variables to binary ones.

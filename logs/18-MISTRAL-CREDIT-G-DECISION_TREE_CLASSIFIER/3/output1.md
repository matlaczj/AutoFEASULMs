 Based on the current iteration history and the available columns, here are 10 new column-tool combinations that could potentially improve the ML Decision Tree Classifier model for predicting 'target':

1. `polynomial_features(checking_status, degree=3)` - Create polynomial features up to degree 3 from the 'checking_status' column to capture more complex relationships with the target variable.
2. `min_max_scaler(credit_history_delayed_previously)` - Normalize the 'credit_history_delayed_previously' column using Min-Max Scaler to bring all values to a comparable scale and avoid bias towards large values.
3. `create_interaction(employment, personal_status)` - Create interaction features between 'employment' and 'personal_status' columns to account for the influence of employment status on credit risk based on individual circumstances.
4. `reduce_dimentionality(existing_credits:, method='PCA')` - Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the 'existing_credits' column and keep only the most significant components that explain maximum variance in the data.
5. `log(installment_commitment)` - Apply log transformation on 'installment_commitment' to make the distribution more normal, as it might be skewed towards larger values and negatively impact model performance.
6. `binarizer(other_debtors_guarantors, threshold=1)` - Convert the binary 'other_debtors_guarantors' column into dummy variables using Binarizer to help the decision tree classifier learn the difference between having and not having debtors/guarantors.
7. `quantile_transformer(age, n_quantiles=10, output_distribution='normal')` - Apply quantile normalization on 'age' column and output normalized values following a normal distribution to bring age values into a more uniform scale.
8. `subtract_columns(credit_amount, duration)` - Subtract the 'duration' column from the 'credit_amount' column to calculate the difference between the loan amount requested and loan tenure, which might be an important factor in determining credit risk.
9. `power_transformer(personal_status, method='yeo-johnson')` - Apply Yeo-Johnson power transformation on 'personal_status' column to adjust for non-linearity and improve the model's ability to learn complex relationships between personal status and credit risk.
10. `one_hot_encoder(purpose)` - Encode the 'purpose' column into one-hot encoded dummy variables to provide separate binary features for each purpose category, making it easier for the decision tree classifier to identify patterns specific to each purpose type.
